# MiganCore 7B "soul" v0.7 — archived early experiment (May 2026)

**Status: archived, superseded, not maintained. Published for research transparency only.** This is an early
iteration of MiganCore's Qwen2.5-7B line. The project later moved to a 4B base and closed on 28 September
2026.

## What it is
- **Base:** Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Apache-2.0).
- **Method:** ORPO with a LoRA adapter, 508 pairs, 2 epochs.

## Training data
508 preference pairs covering identity, voice, style, tool use, creativity and honesty. About 96–97 % of the preferred answers were written by a commercial LLM.

Because training data came from the outputs of third-party commercial LLM services, check the terms of those services before any use beyond research.

## Evaluation
No pre-registered evaluation exists for this version.
